_BOTHPINS

This is a parameter on the primary work plane that indicates when both the A and B pin should be used (for Lockdowel). This is only for small parts or short edges. When you have a small edge, you only have one primary connection, but you have two support pins. We have fixed this value at 192mm. (Any operation on an edge less then 192mm will use both support pins). We set the value at 192mm since the total span of the operation is 64mm, if you were to put two on one edge you would want a 32mm gap between them and at least a 16mm gap from the start/end of the edges. (64+64+32+16+16=192). However, you might want to have control over this value so you can adjust the equation on this parameter.

Values:
 
Numeric (Measurement)
 

Visibility:

Remarks:

The hardware is centralized in a bounding box (blue) as defined by the depth “d” of the hardware. The “centralize” calculations do not currently take the shape of the hardware model into account. In this particular example it is possible that the hardware could be moved slightly more to the SE because of the clipped area (green) but as CABINET VISION does not know what the model shape and dimensions are in the general sense, it is not accounted for. Typically the hardware origin is specified on one of the part edges. The actual model components are offset with their own equations. This means that CABINET VISION in effect needs to situate the hardware as if it were on a rotated piece of material (green). CABINET VISION actually calculates the position of the black dot to get the hardware to position itself correctly. The _DPTH Parameter can be added to the Material to modify the depth “d”. This can be used to adjust the size of the bounding box (light blue line above).  Making the value smaller would make the box wider, while making the value bigger would make the box narrower. The hardware would always be centralized within in the box, effectively moving it SE in the above example.

GROUP

Specifies the group the Operation is associated with. When the S2M CENTER processes operations they are sorted by Group, Operation Type, Priority. Group and Priority allow you to override the operation sorting for an individual operation. Let’s assume you want to add a pocket on the edge of the part, then drill a hole in the pocket.

Standard S2M CENTER operations are by default assigned to group 0.


You would have to assign the pocket a group of 1 or higher...This will make sure it happens after all the standard operations including outline.

If you then have your operation order set to Routing, then Drilling, you could also assign the drill to group 1 since drilling would naturally follow routing.

However, if you have the normal setup (Drill then Route) you would have to give the Drill operation a group of 2 (anything higher than the 1st group) this will ensure the drill occurs after the routing.

Operation Types, of course, are the four listed on the Ordering Tab in the S2M CENTER. See the S2M CENTER Help file for more information on the Ordering Tab.
